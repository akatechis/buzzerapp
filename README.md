# BuzzerApp

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akatechis/buzzerapp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/akatechis/buzzerapp)

## Overview
This application provides a service for teams looking to host game events,
where a buzzer mechanism is desirable, such as trivia competitions.

Currently, only the buzzer mechanism is provided, allowing participants
to enroll in a competition, and subsequently "buzz in" to attempt to answer
a challenge. There is no scoring or persistence mechanism.
